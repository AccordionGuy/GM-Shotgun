# Shotgun!

This app, written for the NGI (Next Generation Infotainment) platform in GMâ€™s new cars, helps resolve a regular dispute: who gets to [ride shotgun](http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/riding-shotgun.html)? The user provides the number of non-driver passengers, and Shotgun randomly determines who gets to sit in the front passenger seat.

As an added bonus, not only does this app determine who sits in the preferred passenger seat, but in the case where there are 5 people in the car, it also determines who has to sit in the dreaded rear middle seat.
